# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen.  
It is a landing page for a coffee shop, created using **HTML** and **CSS**, based on the design brief.  
The website includes a header with navigation, a recipes section with videos, a reservation form for booking a table, and a menu section with food and drinks.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plans for improving the project

- Make the page responsive so it works on phones and tablets
- Add a dark mode theme
- Include form validation messages (for example, alerting if the email is typed incorrectly)
